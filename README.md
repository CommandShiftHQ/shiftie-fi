# Firebase Authentication on the frontend - Shiftie-Fi

This demo is built in React using Vite. It demonstrates how you can achieve frontend user authentication using Firebase Authentication, and how to pass user access tokens to an Express backend.

## Getting started

1. Clone down the [Music Library API exemplar](https://github.com/CommandShiftHQ/be-music-library-cover-image-demo/tree/fe-firebase-auth) and switch to the `fe-firebase-auth` branch.

2. Follow the instructions on the Music Library API README, and fire up Docker and your API.

3. Follow the instructions in the lecture to create a Firebase project and add authentication to your Firebase project through the [Firebase console](https://console.firebase.google.com/).

4. In this repo, copy .env.example to .env, and populate the values from your project's Firebase settings in the Firebase console.

5. In this repo, run `npm i` and `npm start`. Open your browser to http://localhost:5173/ - you should be good to go!
